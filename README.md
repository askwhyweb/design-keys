# Design Key Automation for Magento2
This module is supposed to change the behavior of attributes filter on category page and ideally the target is to fix the category_url.html?design=123 to be fixed as category-url-design-name.html

This module is a partial part of the original working algorithem, while this is just a show case of code how the base code is founded and executed.

I'll explain its usage in a seperate blog post soon.

Thanks
